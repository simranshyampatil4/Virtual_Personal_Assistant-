# Virtual_Personal_Assistant-
Abstract

Virtual Assistant is a software program which uses a deviceâ€™s microphone to receive voice requests while the voice output takes place at the speaker. But the most exciting thing that happens is the actions between these two . It is a combination of several different technologies: voice recognition, voice analysis and language processing. When a user asks a personal assistant to perform a task, the natural language audio signal is converted into digital data that can be analyzed by the software.  Then this data is compared with a database of the software using an innovative algorithm to find a suitable answer.
